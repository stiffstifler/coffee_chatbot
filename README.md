# Coffee Bot  

## Overview  
Coffee Bot is an interactive chatbot designed to streamline the process of ordering drinks at a cafÃ©. The bot guides users through a step-by-step drink selection process, offering customizable options for drink types, sizes, and special additions.  

## Features  
- **Interactive Drink Ordering**: Users can choose from a variety of drink types, including brewed coffee, mocha, and latte.  
- **Customizable Options**:  
  - Drink sizes: Small, Medium, Large.  
  - Special options for mochas and lattes, such as peppermint flavor or different milk types.  
- **Order Management**:  
  - Users can order multiple drinks in one session.  
  - A summary of the complete order is displayed before finalizing.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear prompts and error messages ensure smooth interaction with the chatbot.  

## Technologies and Structure  
- **Python**: The project is implemented using Python, focusing on modular design.  
- **Utils Module**: Helper functions like `print_message`, `get_size`, and `order_latte` are separated into a utility file for cleaner code organization.  

## How It Works  
1. The chatbot welcomes the user and starts the drink selection process.  
2. Users are prompted to:  
   - Select a drink size.  
   - Choose a drink type and any special additions (e.g., peppermint mocha or milk type for lattes).  
3. Users can add multiple drinks to their order.  
4. Once all drinks are selected, the chatbot confirms the order and collects the user's name.  

## Example Interaction
